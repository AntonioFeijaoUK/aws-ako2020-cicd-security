## Building Security In: Methods for Securing Software Development Lifecycles

### Abstract

When we think of securing software development lifecycles, we need to concern ourselves with the security of the produced software as much as the security of the processes involved in building it. During this workshop, you'll learn how to secure your pipelines and how to continuously scan at build time for common security issues in a provided vulnerable application using tools such as Inspector, Zap, Dependency Check and more.
