# Thank You!

Hopefully, you've learned a little more today about the ways in which you can protect CI/CD pipelines, and the software being built within them, using techniques such as dependency checking, vulnerability scanning and declarative job definitions.

If you've finished ahead of time, please feel free to see how else you could make your pipeline more secure. We only scratched the surface here! There are plenty of other things we could have looked at.

**Remember** to delete your CloudFormation stack to avoid incurring costs, in the interest of frugality. Before deleting the stack, please ensure that you empty the S3 bucket that was created else stack deletion will fail.

Feedback is really important in order to make this session a success for future audiences. Please leave session feedback in the app! Every bit of feedback counts, and I'll take it onboard to make this session more successful in future.

Finally, thank you for your time!
